This repository contains the code for a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chatbot designed to assist users by leveraging advanced language models and retrieval mechanisms for accurate and context-aware responses. The chatbot utilizes information from external sources or databases to enhance the user experience by providing more relevant answers.

Features
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): The chatbot is powered by a RAG model that combines retrieval of relevant documents and generation of answers, improving the quality of responses.
Interactive Chatbot: Users can interact with the chatbot to get answers to their questions.
Custom Knowledge Base: The chatbot is trained to pull information from a custom knowledge base, making it capable of providing specific insights.
Scalable Architecture: Designed to be easily extendable and scalable, allowing integration with various data sources.

Goals
Context-Aware Responses: To provide intelligent, contextually relevant answers using the RAG model.
User Customization: Users can update and personalize their data, like adding or managing expenses.
Seamless Interaction: A smooth user experience, where users can ask for various services such as viewing, adding, and editing expense records after successful authentication.

Future Directions
Multi-Language Support: Extend the chatbot to support multiple languages for wider user reach.
Real-Time Data Updates: Enable dynamic updates to the knowledge base for real-time information.
Integration with Financial APIs: Allow users to track their expenses with live data from financial sources.
Improved NLP: Continuously improve the NLP capabilities to handle more complex user queries.
